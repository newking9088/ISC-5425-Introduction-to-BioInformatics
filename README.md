# ISC-5425-Introduction-to-BioInformatics
Catalog  Description: 

This course on bioinformatics provides a quantitative framework for understanding how the genomic sequence and its variations affect the phenotype. The course is designed for biologists and biochemists seeking to improve quantitative data interpretation skills, and for mathematicians, computer scientists and other quantitative scientists seeking to learn more about computational biology. Laboratory exercises are designed to reinforce the classroom learning.

Objectives:

At the end of this course, students will be able to:1) analyze DNA sequence data using the software/scripts covered2) install and learn new related software/scripts without assistance3) summarize the basic classes of algorithms for assembling and aligning DNA sequence data with at least 80% accuracy.4) summarize the similarities among and differences between the commonly used DNA sequence, assembly, and alignment file formats including fasta, fastq, and sam.5) distinguish the differences among the commonly-used models of DNA sequence evolution.6) summarize commonly used methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from DNA sequence alignments.
